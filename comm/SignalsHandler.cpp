/* A brief introduction over signals...
 *
 * The Linux Signals are used for interprocess comunication. This asynchronous
 * mechanism is used to send events to the running processes. For each process, there is a
 * limited range of signals that can be used. Most of them have a standard meaning, e.g. 
 * Crtr-C (INT signal) stands for a user will to shutdown the process. Most of those signals 
 * can be trapped by the application to perform a set of actions, instead of the standard ones.
 * 
 * To trap the signal the user can either register an handler or wait (sigwait) for the signal.
 * Some issues about Signals:
 * 	- A Signal is held in a single event (like a unique interruption) that must then be polled 
 * 	  in order to determine its type. When simultaneous signals occur, only one of them is handled,
 * 	  even for with different signals.
 * 	  Moreover, special cautions must be followed if the a signal handler is assigned, to 
 * 	  avoid signals losses (the signals reception is some how held until the end of the handler).
 *
 * 	- About the sigwait, this is done by blocking the execution while waiting with a specific 
 * 	  signal mask. In a multi-threaded system, one might think that different sigwait calls waiting 
 * 	  with diferent masks in different threads, would solve the issue of catching diferent signals.
 * 	  This is true, but when more than one sigwait is waiting for a signal, even with non-overlaping
 * 	  masks, only one of the sigwait will catch the signal and then unblock if the signal matches 
 * 	  the mask. The sigwait that gets the signal is unspecified.
 *
 * So, in multi-threading systems, if we want a thread to be held in a signal the only way is
 * to register a handler for that signal and then wake some other synchronization mechanism, like
 * mutexes.
 *
 * BTW, there are also the "pthread_" oriented signals. These signals use a signalization API that has 
 * nothing to do with the process signals, except the namespace analogy. It's a similar implementation
 * of signals for intra process  signalization (inter-threads).
